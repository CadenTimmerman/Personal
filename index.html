            <h1>Caden Timmerman</h1>
            <p>Computer Engineer</p>
            <p>I am currently enrolled at Iowa State University
                to become a computer engineer. I have always 
                wanted to learn how computers worked since I 
                was young. It is great to be able to explore 
                these interests at college!

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            
            <p>The first project I will be talking about is 
                my team made recipe finder android app. For a 
                semester project me and three others had worked 
                as a team together to make this recipe finder
                app. It allows you to swipe on recipes and 
                find out what looks good for dinner. It also 
                has a cart to add recipe ingredients.
                You can also leave reviews on recipes that 
                other people have submitted.
